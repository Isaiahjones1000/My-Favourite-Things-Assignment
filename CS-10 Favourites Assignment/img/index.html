    <h1>#2 Video Games</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game" target="_blank"
        >Video Games</a
      >
      have largely influenced my childhood as my dad introduced me to technology
      at a young age and along with that video games. Through this introduction
      I have gained an unending addiction to playing video games and
      specifically with friends as having friends playing games with you makes
      it more enjoyable.
    </p>
    <h3>Why I Decided to Choose Video Games</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It gives a sense of community without ever having to go outside and
        finding that said community
      </li>
      <li>
        It gives me social skills as I talk to my friends and new people
        everyday
      </li>
      <li>
        It builds hand-eye coordination which is helpful for desk jobs that
        require good typing
      </li>
      <li>
        The dopamine gained from playing video games is something that many
        enjoy
      </li>
    </ul>

      has been a key part in my success in life as it has allowed me to be the
      person I am today. From helping me grow, giving me the energy to tackle a
      difficult day, or even resting my eyes after playing video games for way
      too long its always been there.
    </p>

      <li>I usually get postive dreams that raise my mood</li>
      <li>My bed is very comfortable allowing for optimal comfort</li>
      <li>Allows me to escape the harsh reality we all know as life</li>
